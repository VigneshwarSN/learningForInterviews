# Ultimate Developer Interview Roadmap (AI/ML Integration)

**Goal**: Transform from "Basic Awareness" to "Job Ready Developer" in 16 Weeks.
**Time Commitment**: 2-3 Hours / Day (Strict Consistency Required).
**Focus**: Python ecosystem, Full Stack Basic (React + FastAPI), and Applied AI.

> **Note**: This roadmap is designed to build a portfolio. You aren't just reading; you are building.

## Phase 1: The Foundations (Weeks 1-4)
**Objective**: Solidify your tools. You can't build a house without a hammer.

### Week 1: Git & GitHub (The Professional Standard)
*Most beginners ignore this. Don't.*
- **Day 1**: Installation, Setup, `git init`, `git add`, `git commit`.
- **Day 2**: Branching strategies (`checkout`, `branch`, `merge`).
- **Day 3**: Handling Merge Conflicts (Create one on purpose and fix it).
- **Day 4**: GitHub Basics (Push, Pull, Clone, Fork).
- **Day 5**: Pull Requests (PRs) & Code Review basics.
- **Weekend**: **Project 1** - Create a Repo for "Learning-Journey". Push a Markdown file with your goals. Create a branch, add a bio, merge it.

### Week 2: Python Beyond Scripting
*Moving from "It runs" to "It's production-ready".*
- **Day 1**: Virtual Environments (`venv`, `conda`) & Dependency Management (`pip`, `requirements.txt`).
- **Day 2**: List Comprehensions, Dictionaries, and Sets (Performance).
- **Day 3**: Functions (Args, Kwargs, Lambda) & Scope.
- **Day 4**: OOP Basics (Classes, Objects, Inheritance) - Key for ML.
- **Day 5**: File Handling & JSON manipulation.
- **Weekend**: Practice Problems on HackerRank (Python Specific).

### Week 3: SQL Fundamentals
*Data is clear; your queries should be too.*
- **Day 1**: `SELECT`, `FROM`, `WHERE`, `ORDER BY`.
- **Day 2**: Aggregations (`COUNT`, `SUM`, `AVG`, `GROUP BY`).
- **Day 3**: `JOINS` (Left, Inner, Right) - Visualize them.
- **Day 4**: Subqueries & CTEs (Common Table Expressions).
- **Day 5**: Database Design Basics (Primary Keys, Foreign Keys).
- **Weekend**: Solve SQL 50 on LeetCode (Do the first 10).

### Week 4: Applied AI/ML (Basics Refresher)
*Focus on **using** models, not building them from scratch yet.*
- **Day 1**: NumPy & Pandas Crash Course (Data manipulation).
- **Day 2**: Scikit-Learn Workflow (Load data -> Split -> Train -> Predict).
- **Day 3**: Understanding Metrics (Accuracy, Precision, Recall).
- **Day 4**: Saving Models (`pickle`, `joblib`). This is how we deploy!
- **Day 5**: Intro to APIs (What is a REST API?).
- **Weekend**: **Project 2** - Train a simple Iris/Titanic model, save it as a `.pkl` file.

---

## Phase 2: Data Structures & Algorithms (Weeks 5-8)
**Objective**: Pass the "Coding Screen".
*Resource: LeetCode (Easy/Medium) & NeetCode 150*

### Week 5: Arrays & Strings
- **Topics**: Hash Maps, Two Pointers, Sliding Window.
- **Goal**: Solve 2 problems/day.
- **Key Problems**: Two Sum, Valid Anagram, Contains Duplicate.

### Week 6: Recursion & Automation
- **Topics**: Recursion logic, Stack basics.
- **Goal**: Understand the "Call Stack".
- **Key Problems**: Valid Parentheses, Fibonacci Number.

### Week 7: Sorting & Searching
- **Topics**: Binary Search (Concept is vital), Merge Sort understanding.
- **Key Problems**: Binary Search, First Bad Version.

### Week 8: Mock Interview Week
- **task**: Review the **[Problem Solving Guide](./Problem_Solving_Guide.md)**.
- **Action**: Do Pramp.com or a mock interview with a peer.
- **Retrospective**: Where did you get stuck?

---

## Phase 3: Development - The "Stack" (Weeks 9-12)
**Objective**: Build valid software.

### Week 9: The API Layer (FastAPI)
- **Day 1**: Hello World in FastAPI.
- **Day 2**: Pydantic Models (Data Validation).
- **Day 3**: GET vs POST requests.
- **Day 4**: Connecting FastAPI to your ML Model (Load `.pkl` on startup).
- **Day 5**: Swagger UI (Built-in docs).
- **Weekend**: Deploy a local API that accepts Titanic data and returns "Survived: Yes/No".

### Week 10: The Frontend (React.js)
- **Day 1**: Javascript ES6 Refresher (Arrow functions, Destructuring, Promises/Async Await).
- **Day 2**: React Basics (Components, JSX, Props).
- **Day 3**: State Management (`useState`).
- **Day 4**: Effects (`useEffect`) - Fetching data from your API.
- **Day 5**: Styling (TailwindCSS or CSS Modules).
- **Weekend**: Build a static "Profile Page" for yourself.

### Week 11: Integration
- Connect React Frontend to FastAPI Backend.
- Display ML predictions on the UI.
- Handle Loading States and Errors.

### Week 12: CI/CD & Deployment Basics
- **Day 1-2**: Docker Basics (Containerize your App).
- **Day 3-4**: GitHub Actions (Run tests on push).
- **Weekend**: Deploy to Render/Vercel (Free tiers).

## Phase 4: Capstone & Job Hunt (Weeks 13-16)

### Week 13-14: The Capstone Project
**Idea**: "AI Resume Screener" or "Stock Sentiment Analyzer".
- **Tech**: React + FastAPI + SQL + Scikit-Learn.
- **Reqs**: GitHub Repo, Readme, Live Demo link.

### Week 15: Resume & Portfolio
- Polish the Resume (Quantify achievements).
- Polish GitHub Profile (Pins, Readmes).
- LinkedIn Optimization.

### Week 16: The Final Push
- Apply to 5 jobs/day.
- Continue LeetCode (1/day).
- System Design Basics (High Level).
